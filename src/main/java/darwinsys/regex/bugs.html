<h1>Regular Expressions API: Implementation Bugs and TODO</H1>
<p>
This is a tiny litle NFA-style regex implementation,
done by Ian darwin many years ago as a proof-of-concept
and never quite finished.
</p>
<h2>Caveats</H2>
<p>The current implementation is <em>very</em> slow.
The java.util.regex package is several times faster, partly because
it compiles to (its own) byte code.
</P>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
<p>The following bugs are present in this version:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>backtracking is not yet implemented</b>, so a .* followed by something may (i.e., will usually) eat up the something.
</p>
<p>The following functionality is documented but not implemented; 
must be added real soon now.
<ul>
<li>Ignore-case (fix in SE.amatch() arg list, SEchar, SEccl)
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>The following are planned to be implemented Real Soon Now(tm):
<ul>
<li>Use Match match() to write sub() functionality.
</ul>
<p>The following are possible additions.
<ul>
	<li>\f	numeric digits plus . e f (\f+ for floating number)
	<li>\N	any end-of-line character (short for [\r\n])
</ul>
