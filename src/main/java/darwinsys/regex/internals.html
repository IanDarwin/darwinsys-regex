<h1>Regular Expression API - Internals</h1>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p><a href="RE.java">This source file</a> lists the complete
source code of the com.darwinsys.regexp.<em>RE</em> <em>API</em>.
As you've already seen, using regular expressions to match patterns in strings
involves two steps, generally called compiling and matching. </p>

<p>
The matching code in doMatch() simply &quot;walks&quot; the pattern, comparing each token in the pattern to see if there is one or more characters that match it. Accordingly, the two main routines are called <em>
compile</em>
 and <em>
match</em>
. <em>
Compile</em>
 is <em>
static</em>
 so that it can be called from the static compile-and-match method used in <i>Using regular expressions in Java.</i>.  It is called from the constructor in a non-static context, but since it simply returns the constructed pattern, it works as well in either type of context. </p>
<p>
The compiled pattern is interesting. The regular expression is broken down into a series of sub-expressions, and stored as an array of SE objects. Each character, or metacharacter, ^, $, ., multiplier, etc., is represented by an <em>
SE</em>
. The abstract class <em>
<a href="SE.java">SE</a></em>
 provides an <em>
amatch()</em>
 method to see if there is a match between the string we're examining and the current sub-expression. </p>
<p>There are several subclasses of SE:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="SEccl.java">SEccl.java</a>, represents a character class</li>
<li><a href="SEchar.java">SEchar.java</a> represents one literal character</li>
<li><a href="SEmult.java">SEmult.java</a> represents one (greedy) closure</li>
<li><a href="SEor.java">SEor.java</a> represents an alternation</li>
</ul>
The SEor class does not need a corresponding "alternation" object; it
simply has a Left and a Right object, and each of these may represent
more than one object.
<p>
Several subclasses of SE are not shown. For example, <em>
SEchar</em>
 is the subclass used to represent a literal character. SEchar's amatch simply compares the character at the current position in the input against the character it stored. The abstract <em>
SE</em>
 also provides <em>
toString()</em>
, which will only be called if somebody adding a new sub-expression type forgets to provide one (the <em>
Int</em>
 class is our customized re-write of <em>
java.lang.Integer</em>
; it features <em>
incr()</em>
 and <em>
decr()</em>
 methods as well as <em>
set()</em>
 and <em>
get()</em>
 methods, but omits most of the baggage of <em>
Integer</em>
).</p>
<p>
This design greatly simplifies the overall logic of the <em>RE</em> class.
For example, when building it, there was a time when all the primitive
types (characters, character classes, ^, . and $) worked, but the
&quot;or&quot; function | did not exist yet. I was able
to add the <em>
SEor</em>
 subclass just by changing compile() slightly, and do all the rummaging around in <em>
SEor</em>
's amatch, without complicating the code in domatch() that calls it. Again we see the benefits of Java's Object-oriented approach. </p>
<p>
Also note that the simpler, &quot;atomic&quot; SE's such as ^, ., and $ are implemented as anonymous inner classes within the <em>RE</em>
class. Why create a named class when there only needs to be one
instance? Since any one of these might occur several times, and
knowing that any of them is interchangeable, we use the Design
Pattern (see the Gang of Four book of the same name)
known as &quot;flyweight&quot; or ultra-light.
That is, we only create one of each of these, and we use it as
often as necessary. This is a performance optimization. We allocate
all of the &quot;flyweight&quot; objects only once, when the <em>RE</em>
class is loaded (they're <em>static</em>), and they are then available
for use by any instance of the <em> RE</em>
class. To implement this, we only had to change the <em>compile()</em>
method to insert references to the appropriate flyweight into the list
of SE's instead of constructing a new instance each time.  </p>
