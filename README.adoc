== Regular Expressions API

This is a tiny litle NFA-style regex implementation,
done by Ian Darwin many years ago as a proof-of-concept
and never fully polished.

Status: 66 of 150 tests (based on Henry Spencer's rigorous tests for his regex package) did not pass.
That is 84 tests that did pass, at least.
