<H1>Regular Expressions API: Implementation Bugs and TODO</H1>
<H2>Caveats</H2>
<P>The current implementation is <EM>very</EM> slow.
The Apache Jakarta regexp is several times faster, partly because
it compiles to (its own) byte code.
</P>
<H2>Bugs</H2>
<P>The following bugs are present in this version:
	<BR><b>backtracking is not yet implemented</b>, so a .* followed by something may (i.e., will usually) eat up the something.
</P>
<P>The following functionality is documented but not implemented; 
must be added real soon now.
	<BR>-- Ignore-case (SE.amatch() arg list, SEchar, SEccl)
</P>
<H2>Future work</H2>
<P>The following are planned to be implemented very soon:
	<BR>-- Use Match match() to write sub() functionality.
</P>
<P>The following are possible later.
	<BR>\f	numeric digits plus . e f (\f+ for floating number)
	<BR>\N	any end-of-line character (short for [\r\n])
</P>
